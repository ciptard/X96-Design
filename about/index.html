            Howdy. I'm a young, aspiring web nerd on the west coast of Canada. My passion is programming and designing, and I've been doing just that since the age of eight.

            <h1>The History</h1>
            <p>My dad bought a book for himself on HTML because he wanted to build a family website for us. A couple years afterward, I found the book and my dad said I could have it.</p>
            <p>I read that book cover-to-cover too many times to count. I memorized everything the book had to offer.</p>
            <p>Originally, I stated on the only computer I had, an old Windows 95 Compaq that my parents got on sale at some computer repair shop. My first website was an Intranet site for my secret spy company (I was 8).</p>
            <p>From there, I got to where I am now: writing much better code, designing websites using current technology and specs, and, best of all, continuing to pursue what I love doing.</p>

            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>This site is running on pure, static HTML. No CMS, no backend coding, just clean, simple static HTML files.</p>
            <p>I'm using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> as a web server, but I prefer <a href="http://nginx.org/">NGINX</a> (long story). The server is a <a href="http://rackspacecloud.com/">Rackspace Cloud Server</a> running Ubuntu 11.04.</p>
            
            <p>The site will look decent in all the web browsers that actually work (Firefox, Chrome, Safari). I've done basic testing in Internet Explorer (just enough so it'll somewhat resemble what it's supposed to look like). Opera I don't care about (and, quite frankly, I'm not sure if anyone does).</p>

            <h1>Aside From Code…</h1>
            <p>Although running a web design company <em>is</em> a large part of my life, there are also many other things I enjoy doing. Such as…</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Drumming</strong> &mdash; I've been playing drums for almost four years. I play everything from smooth jazz songs with brushes, to hardcore metal with thirty-second-note double bass.</li>
              <li><strong>Writing</strong> &mdash; I try to write as much as I can. I find writing a relaxing activity, and it's another thing I'm very passionate about. I <a href="http://alexblackie.ca/">have a blog</a> <a href="http://nerdinthebasement.com/">or two</a> and try to update them regularly.</li>
